Urgent !!

I repeated again and again. Could Anyone write the report with explanation on theory what happen when query statement like
			 "  SELECT   S.sname\n"
			 "  FROM     Sailors S, Boats B, Reserves R\n"
			 "  WHERE    S.sid = R.sid AND S.rating > 7 AND R.bid = B.bid \n"
			 "           AND B.color = 'red'

should be processed to get the execution plan A, B, C... up to when decided which one is the best (In Detail, step by step )

Because frankly I dont understand the Theory... please... you help me in that part so I implement that in the code..

Tomorrow Friday I have a class "Statistic Machine Learning" on 12 to 3 with presentation, so I wont be at DBMS class

I'll come to lab session at 14:30
